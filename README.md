## What is it

My second mature project. The app is to educate, help and motivate user to use Zero/Less waste ideology in everyday life.

The app has three main goals: 

- educate about Zero Waste way of life, 
- through gamification model motivate user to be more friendly for our earth :),
- eco-map will show nearby places which support zero waste strategies.



Technical goals:


- used Clean Swift software architecture 

- coding best practices and SOLID principles

- systematic code review

- all stages approved by mentor

- all critical parts of application covered by unit tests with use of Bitrise CI

  


Prototype stage:
- [x] prototype interactive presentation can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/222dbc00-60f8-478e-4efa-695104083ddb-541c/?fullscreen)

  

Coding stage:

- [x] initial setup of project, add .gitignore
- [x] setup bundler, cocoapods
- [x] add SwiftLint, R.swift, lottie, Quick, Nimble pods
- [x] create predefined templates files for Clean Swift project
- [ ] add Ecomap scene
- [ ] add ActivityTiles scene
- [ ] add AcitivityInfo scene
- [ ] add ActivityStats scene
- [ ] add Library scene
- [ ] add UserAccount scene
- [ ] add ...

- *[Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick)* - behavior-driven development framework for Swift and Objective-C

- *[Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)* - express the expected outcomes of Swift or Objective-C expressions

- *[Gifski](https://gif.ski)* - converts videos to GIF animations

- *[Typora](https://typora.io)* - a truly minimal markdown editor

## Clean Swift Project Templates

If you want to try creating your own project using Clean Swift guidelines, there is a set of custom templates added in Templates/CleanSwift folder.

Just copy it to your  `/Users/<username>/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates` folder and use it as you like.

- **Scene** - creates set of 7 files to use for your scene - *use it for every new scene*,

- **SceneSupport** - creates set of 16 files with predefined functionalities like presenting spinner, presenting alert, networking files, etc - *use it once per project*,

- **UnitTestsXC** - creates set of 8 files needed to test your scene using XCTest (fake files included) - *use it for every scene*,

- **UnitTestsXCSupport** - creates set of 5 files to support tests for your scene - *use it once per project tests module*
